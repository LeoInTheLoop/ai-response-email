A Thought – What if Product Insights Could Tell the Story Behind the Data?,"Hi Mr. Tagesson,What if your Product Insights platform didn’t just visualize the data—but told the story behind it?Imagine an AI agent that connects multiple charts—sales spikes, marketing spends, stock levels—and weaves them into a narrative: “Your February sales dropped 12% despite increased ad spend. Meanwhile, inventory turnover slowed, suggesting a misalignment in campaign timing.” This kind of insight, written in clear natural language, would make your forecasts not only visible, but explainable—giving users instant clarity and confidence in their next move.This is the kind of agent I would love to build with Dema.ai.I'm Lingyu Kong, a master’s student at Stockholm University with a strong interest in AI agents. Before that, I spent several years as a financial analyst and developer, building internal tools that served over 100 users and enabled data‑driven decisions in high‑stakes environments. I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it can be for non‑technical users to extract actionable insight from even the best dashboards.That’s why I’m here—to share this thought with you and see if it resonates.I’ve attached my résumé and would be thrilled to discuss how this idea could take shape at Dema.ai—whether as a student project, internship, or collaboration.Looking forward to your thoughts!Warm regards,Lingyu Kong"
